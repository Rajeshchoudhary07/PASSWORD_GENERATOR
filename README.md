# PASSWORD_GENERATOR
A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. This project aims to create a
password generator application using Python, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.

1 User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.

2 Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.

3 Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.

### Introduction 
The password generator is a Python program designed to create strong, random passwords based on user-specified length and complexity. With increasing concerns about online security, using strong and unique passwords for different accounts is crucial. This program helps users generate such passwords quickly and securely.

#### Key features of the password generator code include:

1 User Input: The program prompts users to specify the desired password length, making it adaptable to different needs.

2 Password Complexity: Users can select the complexity level of the password:

  (i) Lowercase letters only.
  
  (ii) Lowercase and uppercase letters.
  
  (iii) Letters and digits.
  
  (iv) Letters, digits, and special characters.
  
3 Random Generation: The program uses Python's random and string libraries to generate a secure and random password based on the specified criteria.

4 Error Handling: The program includes validation to ensure users provide valid inputs for length and complexity.

This project is a great way for beginners to explore Python's string manipulation and random number generation, while also offering practical utility in everyday security practices.
